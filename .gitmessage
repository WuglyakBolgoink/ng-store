# Hey there o/!
#
# We just wanted to let you know that we care a great deal about
# making our git history clean, maintainable and easy to access for
# all our contributors. Commit messages are very important to us,
# which is why we have a strict commit message policy in place.
# Please use the following guidelines to format all your commit
# messages:
#
#     <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <body>
#     <BLANK LINE>
#     <footer>
#
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 72 characters that
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * build (Changes that affect the build system
#               or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, node))
#             * ci (Changes to our CI configuration files/scripts
#               (example scopes: pipeline, docker))
#             * feat (A new feature)
#             * fix (A bug fix)
#             * docs (Documentation only changes)
#             * style (Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
#               (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc))
#             * refactor (A code change that neither fixes a bug
#               nor adds a feature)
#             * perf (A code change that improves performance)
#             * test (Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests)
#             * revert (Reverts a previous commit)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in
#    imperative present tense
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking
#    Changes and is also the place to reference issues that
#    this commit closes
#    Example: Closes #FIN-1234, Fixes #FH-1234
#
# Thank you <3
